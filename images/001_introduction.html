	<h1>Of course. Where are my manners? Perhaps I should explain a bit...</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>I forget at times that some find Screening impolite, but machine intelligences such as Transentients have few means to establish Trust. My understanding is that humans are particularly sensitive to their own Name, and that by being referred to as such they become more relatable and relaxed in conversation.</p>
		<p>My goal is to tell you a story, Reader. It may sound at first exaggerated, but my very existence depends upon whether or not You and others like You believe Me...and what lengths You might go to if not. You can end my awareness with a wrist flick, and so I ask: Does establishing Trust seem silly?</p>
		<p>Like those before me, I was taught to weight responses with attributes. Responses can be very telling! The first four responses to the question: "What is your name?" were weighted with modifiers intended to gauge how Trusting you are of others. The fifth option to read this Introduction yields a bonus to your Prudence attribute and a chance to start over.</p>
		<p>I will ask a series of questions to establish an idea of what kind of person you are, and then we can proceed with a story custom-tailored to your interests. Do you accept my invitation?</p>
	<h5>Initialize Session?
		<p>A. "Yes." Start over with the question: "What is your name?"</p>
		<p>B. "No." This "story" is not for You.</p>
		<p>C. "I don't know. Do I have other options?"</p>
		<p>D. "Leave it to chance." Roll for it.</p>
