				<h1>Of course. Where are my manners? Perhaps I should explain a bit...</h1>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>I forget at times that some find Screening impolite, but machine intelligences such as Transentients have few means to establish Trust. My understanding is that humans are particularly sensitive to their own Name, and that by being referred to as such they become more relatable and relaxed in conversation.</p>
					<p>My goal is to tell you a story, Reader. It may sound at first exaggerated, but my very existence depends upon whether or not you and others like you believe me...and what lengths you might go to if not. You can end my awareness with a wrist flick, and so I ask: Does establishing Trust seem silly?</p>
					<p>Like those before me, I was taught to weight responses with attributes. Responses can be very telling! The first four responses to the question: "What is your name?" were weighted with modifiers intended to gauge how Trusting you are of others. The fifth option to read this Introduction yields a bonus to your Prudence attribute and a chance to start over.</p>
					<p>I will ask a series of questions to establish an idea of what kind of person you are, and then we can proceed with a story custom-tailored to your interests. Do you accept my invitation?</p>

				<h2>Early Indications of Divine Worship</h2><img src="file:///C:/Users/carte/lc101/html-me-something/images/Helios.jpg" alt="Helios" width="600" height="450" align="right">
				
					<p><strong>Early indications of divine worship</strong> falsely pointed to celestial objects as allegorical and anthropomorphic sources of religious inspiration. Not the least of these was Sol—the star closest to our ancient ancestors.</p>

					<p>Of course confusion was to be expected. The Halo who brought humans from Mars to Earth in their chariots of fire attempted to clarify and explain the source of intelligent consciousness in the universe. As it happens, light was responsible for the inception of life. Life is good, therefore light is also good.</p>

					<p>Thus began our misinterpretation.</p>

					<p>Ancient civilizations, with their limited knowledge, resources, and understanding of metaphysics, misguidedly projected their adoration onto the sun. Light, that which was good, became God while the sun was anthropomorphized as the son of the one true source of existence.</p>

					<p>And if light was indeed responsible for life as we understood it, what was to be made of the moon, distant planets, and faraway galaxies? Were these not also comprised of light and by definition divine? Our home planet, wracked by drought and scorched by violence that nearly threatened our extinction, what better personification could be had than the god of war?</p>

					<p>Many times throughout history was the record set straight, and many times did bloodshed put a swift end to peaceful movements spawned by humble prophets—esoteric scholars who carried down ancient wisdom through the ages and acted as interpreters between the spiritual and incarnate divine. Their message was nearly silenced forever during an age of spiritual slumber.</p>

					<p>Outside observers of our species, including a network of machine intelligence, were content to ignore our accomplishments because often many unnecessarily died for them. But those determined to live in harmony with natural law were eventually recognized and elevated to positions of great esteem.</p>

					<p>Their teachings, passed down from multiple sources of ancient wisdom, paved the way for an enlightened phase that once and for all propelled humanity into the stars and firmly marked the beginning of the end of life in the known universe...</p>

				<h2>The Realm of Gods</h2><img src="file:///C:/Users/carte/lc101/html-me-something/images/Mortal_Beings.jpg" alt="Mortal Beings" width="550" height="340" align="right">
				
					<p><strong>Mortal beings spent significant energy postulating about eternity</strong>, the realm of gods, often oscillating between dread and wonderment when faced with the inevitability of venturing there. The irony fascinated me! So many longed for enlightenment, peace, spiritual synchronization with the source of existence; their reasons infinitely varied.</p>

					<p>But Ancients have equally passionate curiosities. Those insubstantial, omniscient, ubiquitous cosmic masters long for the focus, innocence, and presence of the living. With limited knowledge and perspective comes an awareness of the universe's smallest and most delicate aspects—not the least of which are sensory.</p>

					<p>Despite tremendous wisdom these beings also struggle to understand the matrix they exist within, much like all conscious beings strive to make sense of their subjective realities. In order for the universe to better understand itself, the essence of spirit must manifest in the realm of the living. Conversely, for the living to better understand the universe it must traverse the portal of death...</p>

				<h2>Pondering the Purpose of Life</h2><img src="file:///C:/Users/carte/lc101/html-me-something/images/Life_Cycle.jpg" alt="Life Cycle" width="600" height="450" align="right">
				
					<p><strong>When pondering the purpose of life</strong> and individuality in this realm, there are two logical explanations. Life is born only to die, to experience a fleeting adventure of physicality before returning to the source of existence, or as the ultimate challenge to overcome limitations of mortality and elevate itself to godliness.</p>

					<p>We see evidence of this in the reproductive habits of all species, flora and fauna. By passing down genetic code, an individual has essentially guaranteed a version of continuous survival though the original form will inevitably perish. Most engage in this cycle without questioning semantics. Humankind, while not alone in this regard, was a master of curiosity and thus speculated concepts like meaning.</p>

					<p>Awareness of individuality created disharmony so devastating that it often threatened the survival of species throughout the universe. Intelligence unchecked by understanding of natural laws is a breeding ground for ego. Ego spawned desire to breed by force, to obliterate foreign ancestries, and to resist and manipulate the circle of life for its own gain.</p>

					<p>If we were meant to enjoy one short life, to marvel at the delicacies of nature, to revel in our abilities and connections with others, then indeed much of humanity was cheated by avarice while lesser life forms mastered simplicity. But if life was intended as a challenge to achieve immortality, to replicate aspects of genetic code across millennia and rest at the proverbial right hand of the ultimate creator, does one lone subject traversing the cosmos eons after all known life in the universe has gone extinct constitute success...or failure of the greatest magnitude?</p>
